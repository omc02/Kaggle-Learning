## Introduction to Machine Learning

#### Section 1 - How Models Work
The first step if you're new to machine learning. 

#### Section 2 - Basic Data Exploration
Load and understand your data. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/02-exercise-explore-your-data_Omar%20Chehab.ipynb).

#### Section 3 - Your First Machine Learning Model
Building your first model. Hurray! Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/03-exercise-your-first-machine-learning-model_Omar%20Chehab.ipynb).

#### Section 4 - Model Validation
Measure the performance of your model ? so you can test and compare alternatives. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/04-exercise-model-validation.ipynb).

#### Section 5 - Underfitting and Overfitting
Fine-tune your model for better performance. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/05-exercise-underfitting-and-overfitting.ipynb).

#### Section 6 - Random Forests
Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/06-exercise-random-forests.ipynb).


#### Section 7 - Exercise: Machine Learning Competitions
Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/07-exercise-machine-learning-competitions.ipynb).


## Pandas 

#### Section 1 - Creating, Reading and Writing
You can't work with data if you can't read it. Get started here. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Pandas/01-exercise-creating-reading-and-writing.ipynb).

#### Section 2 - Indexing, Selecting & Assigning
Pro data scientists do this dozens of times a day. You can, too! Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Pandas/02-exercise-indexing-selecting-assigning.ipynb).


#### Section 3 - Summary Functions and Maps
Extract insights from your data. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Pandas/03-exercise-summary-functions-and-maps.ipynb).

#### Section 4 - Grouping and Sorting
Scale up your level of insight. The more complex the dataset, the more this matters. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Pandas/04-exercise-grouping-and-sorting.ipynb).

#### Section 5 - Data Types and Missing Values
Deal with the most common progress-blocking problems. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Pandas/05-exercise-data-types-and-missing-values.ipynb).

#### Section 6 - Renaming and Combining
Data comes in from many sources. Help it all make sense together. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Pandas/06-exercise-renaming-and-combining.ipynb).
