## Introduction to Machine Learning

Section 1 - How Models Work
The first step if you're new to machine learning. 

Section 2 - Basic Data Exploration
Load and understand your data. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/02-exercise-explore-your-data_Omar%20Chehab.ipynb).

Section 3 - Your First Machine Learning Model
Building your first model. Hurray! Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/03-exercise-your-first-machine-learning-model_Omar%20Chehab.ipynb).


Section 4 - Model Validation
Measure the performance of your model ? so you can test and compare alternatives. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/04-exercise-model-validation.ipynb).


Section 5 - Underfitting and Overfitting
Fine-tune your model for better performance. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/05-exercise-underfitting-and-overfitting.ipynb).

Section 6 - Random Forests
Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/06-exercise-random-forests.ipynb).


Section 7 - Exercise: Machine Learning Competitions
Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/omc02/Kaggle-Learning/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/07-exercise-machine-learning-competitions.ipynb).
