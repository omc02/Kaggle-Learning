you're interested in predicting the demand for taxis.  Towards this goal, you'd like to create a plot that shows a rolling average of the daily number of taxi trips.  Amend the (partial) query below to return a DataFrame with two columns:\n","- `trip_date` - contains one entry for each date from January 1, 2016, to March 31, 2016.\n","- `avg_num_trips` - shows the average number of daily trips, calculated over a window including the value for the current date, along with the values for the preceding 3 days and the following 3 days, as long as the days fit within the three-month time frame.  For instance, when calculating the value in this column for January 3, 2016, the window will include the number of trips for the preceding 2 days, the current date, and the following 3 days.\n","\n","This query is partially completed for you, and you need only write the part that calculates the `avg_num_trips` column.
